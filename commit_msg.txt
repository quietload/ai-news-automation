feat: add text overlay to news images with fallback

New approach:
- Images include headline as text overlay
- More realistic images with people allowed
- Text overlay helps avoid portrait rights issues

Fallback:
- If content policy error on individual image, retry with abstract style
- Ensures image generation always succeeds
- Logs "(with text)" or "(fallback)" for debugging
