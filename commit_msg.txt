feat: use US Eastern time for display dates

Changed display dates from local (KST) to US Eastern time:
- Opening images date text (1/4 format)
- Breaking news opening date
- Thumbnail date text
- Video/Shorts title date (e.g., "Today's Top News - Jan 04")

File timestamps still use local time (for file management).
Target audience is US, so display should match their timezone.
